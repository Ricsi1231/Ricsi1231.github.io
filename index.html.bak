            <H1>Hi, I'm <span>Nagy Richárd</span> Mechatronics engineer</H1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I'm passionate about electronics, automation, robotics, and programming electrical devices. 
                Beyond my vocational secondary school education, I've self-taught with great efficiency, participating in five competitions and an enriching Erasmus program. 
                Currently pursuing a Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate major at the Technical College in Subotica, I believe in the convergence of mechanical, electrical, and IT knowledge to meet the demands of modern devices. 
                In my journey, I've tackled challenging projects, honing skills in electronics (analog, digital, power), automation, robotics, and programming electrical devices. I've actively applied this knowledge in competitions and international experiences, constantly seeking ways to push boundaries. Let's connect and explore opportunities together. Feel free to reach out via email at richardnagy551@gmail.com. Check out my reference projects on my GitHub page to get a glimpse of my work.
