            <H1>Hi, I'm <span>Nagy Richárd</span> Mechatronics engineering student</H1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I'm passionate about electronics, automation, robotics, and programming electrical devices. 
                <br>
                <br>
                During high school, I self-taught a lot about embedded systems (Hardware - Software), industrial automation and robotics,
                which led me to compete in five competitions and participate in an Erasmus program. Currently,
                I’m pursuing a Mechatronics Engineering degree at Subotica Tech - College of Applied Sciences.
                <br>
                <br>
                I work as an Embedded Systems and Electrical Engineer at PIERRE, where I focus on designing custom hardware.
                When I'm not working on hardware, I develop firmware in C++ to create innovative solutions.
                <br>
