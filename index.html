            <H1>Hi, I'm <span>Nagy Richárd</span> Mechatronics engineering student</H1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I'm passionate about electronics, automation, robotics, and programming electrical devices. 
                <br>
                Beyond my vocational secondary school education, I've self-taught with great efficiency, participating in five competitions and an enriching Erasmus program. 
                <br> 
                Currently pursuing a Mechatronics engineering undergraduate major at Subotica Tech - College of Applied Sciences. <br>
                In my journey, I've tackled challenging projects, honing skills in electronics, automation, robotics, and programming electrical devices. <br>
                I've actively applied this knowledge in competitions and international experiences, constantly seeking ways to push boundaries. <br> 
                Let's connect and explore opportunities together. Feel free to reach out via email at richardnagy551@gmail.com. <br>
